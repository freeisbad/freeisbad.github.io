<h3 id="cover-pages">Cover Pages</h3>

<p>The new design doubles down on Hydejack as your personal site. The new Cover Pages let visitors know what you‚Äôre about at a glance, showing your logo or profile picture, tagline or description, and selection of social media icons.</p>

Sliding over a cover page will reveal the content below.</p>

<h3 id="lazy-loading-images">Lazy-Loading Images</h3>

<p>Using lots of images can severely impact the performance of a site. It can also cause layout quirks when images pop into existence.
In Hydejack 8 you have the option to provide <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">width</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">height</code> information for your images and let Hydejack lazy-load them as readers scroll the page.</p>

Images are loaded as they are scrolled into view.</p>

<h3 id="better-blog-layout">Better Blog Layout</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blog</code> layout finally catches up to modern design standards and renders a posts‚Äôs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image</code> as part of the preview, giving it a tastier look that makes visitors more likely to engage.</p>

<h3 id="dark-mode--coming-soon">Dark Mode üåó (coming soon)</h3>

<h3 id="offline-support-Ô∏è">Offline Support ‚ö°Ô∏è</h3>

<p>Version 8 introduces experimental offline support. This allows visitors to navigate your site while offline and continue reading articles when connectivity is lost. It also improves loading times for repeat visitors dramatically.</p>
